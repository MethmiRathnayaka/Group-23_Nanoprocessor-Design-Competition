2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PC_0/D_FF1/JMP_Address_reg[2]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) Instruction_Decoder_0/JMP_Address_reg[0]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/JMP_Address_reg[1]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/JMP_Address_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PC_0/D_FF1/LS_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) Instruction_Decoder_0/Reg_S_1_reg[0]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/Reg_S_1_reg[1]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/Reg_S_1_reg[2]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/Reg_S_2_reg[0]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/Reg_S_2_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PC_0/D_FF2/JMP_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) Instruction_Decoder_0/JMP_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
